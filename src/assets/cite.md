Chip design: “This is an inside look into the internal world of the chip's big brain power. Chips are an integral part of the system, without it, there’s no operation. It’s an imaginative take on chip design to show its complexities in a more artistic way. Being part of this project is such a wonderful experience. I couldn’t ask for a better collaboration. As an artist, working with creative freedom is one of the best things ever.” Artist: Champ Panupong Techawongthawon
