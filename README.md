# Quick Question: ChatGPT Clone with Spaced Interval Flashcards

The **Quick Question** Vite app is a ChatGPT clone with a twist â€“ it incorporates spaced interval flashcards for effective learning based on the principles of spaced repetition. Quick Question helps you learn and retain information more efficiently.

## How Quick Question Works

Quick Question leverages the power of memory intervals to reinforce your learning over time, a concept popularized by Dr. Barbara Oakley's "Learning How to Learn" course and book:

- **Dr. Barbara Oakley's Insights**: Inspired by the teachings of [Dr. Barbara Oakley](https://barbaraoakley.com/books/learning-how-to-learn/) in her "Learning How to Learn" course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/), Quick Question employs research-backed learning techniques.

Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Learning (Day 0)**: Start by learning new material as you normally would, focusing on understanding the content.

2. **First Repetition (Day 1)**: The next day (ideally within 12 to 24 hours), return to the study material and review it briefly. Since you still remember most of it, this review only takes 5-10 minutes.

3. **Second Repetition (Day 3)**: After three days, revisit the material. If you still remember it well, proceed to the next step.

4. **Subsequent Intervals**: Continue the spaced repetition with intervals such as 7 days, 21 days, 30 days, 45 days, and finally, 60 days. These intervals are carefully designed to optimize memory retention.

By spacing out your repetitions over time, your brain recognizes the importance of the information, a technique highlighted by [CzechUniversities](https://www.czechuniversities.com/article/study-skills-7-spaced-repetition#:~:text=Ideal%20intervals%20are%20as%20follows,into%20your%20long%2Dterm%20memory), and stores it in your long-term memory. When you actively use this knowledge, it becomes nearly impossible to forget.

## Features of Quick Question

- **Chat with AI**: Engage in text-based conversations with the AI model, similar to OpenAI's GPT-3.

- **Generate Content**: Use Quick Question to generate content, summaries, or answers to your questions.

- **Spaced Interval Flashcards**: Create flashcards with spaced repetition intervals to aid in your learning and retention.

- **Customizable Intervals**: Tailor the repetition intervals to match your learning needs.

- **Effective Learning**: Maximize your study efficiency and long-term knowledge retention.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
